Submissions of homeworks go in this directory.

They should be submitted as `hw##.ipynb`, where `##` is
the homework number number. Your group submits a single 
homework.

You should tag your submission with `hw##_submission`. To
tag a commit, e.g., of homework 1, do
	git git tag -a hw01_submission -m "Submission of homework 1"

Each homework *problem* must be committed as single Jupyter notebook.
The file names must be hw##_prob#.ipynb.
