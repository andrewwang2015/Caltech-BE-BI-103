    "Mean and Standard Deviation: Quick to calculate and can be used to find the MAP for a parameter easily. Particularly useful for normally distributed data. The main drawback is that it essentially requires data to be bounded and symmetrical, otherwise the mean and standard deviation are not very telling.\n",

    "Medians plus Quartiles: It works when mean and standard deviation doesn't; that is, when the data is unbounded for symmetrical. It is also rather intuitive to interpret. However, if the data is extremely skewed, the quartiles and outliers may be confusing and misleading.\n",

    "In a heavy-tailed distribution, the probability does not fall off as drastically as you move further from the mean. In a Gaussian for example, as you move from the mean, the probability falls very quickly to values very close to 0. Heavy-tailed distributions are useful in dealing with potential outliers because it naturally includes them in the model, as opposed to say a Gaussian which would contort the mean (and entire distributin) to stretch for the outliers."
