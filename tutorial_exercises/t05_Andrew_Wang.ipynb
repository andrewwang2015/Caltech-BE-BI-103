    "Heavy tailed distributions have it so that values far away from the mean have probabilities that are so close to 0 as in the case of Gaussian. This is helpful for outliers because in the case of a Gaussian distribution, the rest of model will change to reduce the deviations of the outlier. Using a heavy-tailed in this case will account for such outliers so that the model fits better and will not have to contort itself to accomomodate such outliers.\n"
