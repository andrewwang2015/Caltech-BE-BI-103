    "To compare two models, first we must compute the odds ratio. To do this, we compute/approximate the integral of the posterior, which will be our evidence. At this point we can find the ratio of the evidences through either Laplace approximation or PTMCMC. Assuming equal priors, we can now calculate the odds ratio. If the ratio is less than 1, then the model of the denominator is more likely; otherwise, the numerator's model is more likely."

    "Unlike a creation such as a rag to clean things with, we cannot judge the quality of a model solely by how well it performs its task. With a rag, we can try using it and see if it has cleaned to our satisfaction. However, with a model, we do not know if it is performing its intended task well (modeling the data), because without any other model, we cannot possibly have any intuition to guide our judgement. It is necessary to have a baseline against which we may consider quantitative assessment of the model at hand."
