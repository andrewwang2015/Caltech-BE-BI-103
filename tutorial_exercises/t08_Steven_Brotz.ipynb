    "# Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A periodogram is a plot of magnitude vs. frequency of a signal. It may be interpreted as the contribution of each frequency to the total signal. It is the result of performing a Fourier Transform on a frequency vs. time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "An unsmoothed signal likely contains cusps/peaks which would result in gaps/inaccuracies in the derivative of the signal. Therefore, assessing the time derivative of a signal requires data smoothing for accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 3\n",
    "\n",
    "ROI means \"Region of interest\", which refers to the pertinent part of the image i.e. the part of the image under scrutiny/analysis/interest. Raw images contain vast information, and it is intuitive that we need to narrow down what we study to make any sense of the data presented."
