    "While a Student's t-distribution is used for samples from a population and not the entire population itself, we are often justified in describing the sample as Gaussian if it is large enough, because as sample size grows, the distribution more closely resembles the population. \n",

    "How would you expect each of the following to be distributed?\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** The amount of time between repressor-operator binding events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repressor-operator binding events can be described as Poisson point processes because they are seemingly randomly distributed. Because of this, the times between repressor-operator binding events form an **exponential** distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** The number of times a repressor binds its operator in a given hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **Poisson** distribution. We see this because we are looking at a discrete event to randomly occur in a given time period. This is exactly a Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** The amount of time (in total minute of baseball played) between no-hitters in Major League Baseball.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like problem a), there is a rare event seeming to randomly occur, which we can describe as  Poisson point process. And thus, the times between these events are **exponentially** distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** The number of no-hitters in a Major League Baseball season.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is to b), as c) is to a). We have a discrete event that randomly occurs in a given time frame (a baseball season), and so this is a P\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, try to match these biological stories to the stories of named distributions. For those of you not familiar with baseball, a no-hitter is a game in which a team concedes no hits to the opposing team. There have only been a few hundred no-hitters in over 200,000 MLB games."
