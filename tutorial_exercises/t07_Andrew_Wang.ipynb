    "A parametric model captures data and assumes the data comes from some type of background/ probability distribution while a non-parametric model makes no such assumptions and simply uses the raw data to draw conclusions. For example, the Poisson family of distributions can be though of as parametric while a histogram is a nonparametric estimate of a probability distribution. "

    "For the frequentist confidence interval, we are giving an estimate of a unknown parameter from the data and then giving a sense of how confident/ how good we think the estimate is. For the Bayesian approach, instead of saying the parameter has one true value, it assumes that the parameter's true value comes from the prior probability distribution.  We then calculate the posterior based on the given data or the probability of different values of the parameter given the data. Likewise, a credible region given by a range of values of posterior that include a certain percentage of the posterior can be given from the approach. \n",
